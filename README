== Welcome to NGOAIDMAP

NGOAIDMAP is a website available at http://ngoaidmap.org/. It was a custom development done initially by Vizzuality (vizzuality.com) for Interaction (interaction.org). The application consist of a database of projects. Those projects get aggregated to create Sites, for example http://foodsecurity.ngoaidmap.org/ or http://haiti.ngoaidmap.org/

It is probably a very specific application to be used directly, but the ideas and code behind it might be applicable for other people needs. If you have questions on how to use contact@vizzuality.com

== Database structure

NGOAIDMAP is a project that allows you to create websites about projects around a certain topic. For example haiti or foodsecurity.

The database consist of 4 main tables: "projects" done by "organizations" funded by "donors" which are included in different "sites".
