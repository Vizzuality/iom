        </div>

      <div class="body">
        <p>NGO Aid Map is an InterAction initiative focused on collecting information on NGOs  work at the project level and making it accessible to donors, NGOs, businesses, governments and the public through an online, interactive mapping tool. By sharing this information, we seek to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase transparency within the NGO community</li>
          <li>Facilitate partnerships and improve coordination among NGOs, private sector, governments and donors</li>
          <li>Help NGOs and others involved in relief and development make more informed decisions about where to direct their resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NGO Aid Map uses the latest technology to pinpoint projects by area, sector and magnitude to demonstrate the depth of the work of the NGO community around the world.  Best practices are highlighted in select areas, allowing for information sharing on effective approaches.  </p>
        <p>Although the initiative is still in its early stages, to date we have established aid maps focused on <a href="http://haiti.ngoaidmap.org">Haiti</a> and <a href="http://foodsecurity.ngoaidmap.org">Food Security</a>. </p>
        <p>We welcome your feedback and suggestions on NGO Aid Map.  Please email us at <a href="mailto:mappinginfo@interaction.org">mappinginfo@interaction.org</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>FOCUS AREAS</h3>
        <p>Our mapping work is currently focused on two areas:</p>
        <p><a href="http://foodsecurity.ngoaidmap.org">Food Security</a>: With funding from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), InterAction has developed Food Security Aid Map to provide detailed project-level information on food security and agriculture projects being done by NGOs and the US NGO Working Group on IFAD and Rural Poverty.</p>
        <p><a href="http://haiti.ngoaidmap.org">Haiti</a>: Since the earthquake in January 2010, InterAction, in partnership with BCLC and with funding from FedEx, has developed a web-based mapping platform to highlight NGOs programs in Haiti.  InterAction has been working closely with its members to develop a data collection system that is flexible and can be deployed in future emergencies.</p>
        <br/>
